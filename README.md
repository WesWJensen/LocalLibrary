This is a Thinkful project entitled Local Library. The assignment was to make a webpage that allowed folks to search through books on a library page. Some of the 
categories were 'top ten' or by genre. This challenge was focused on my ability to sort. A big effort was the aspect of making sure books could be marked as checked
out. I learned how to read someone else's code throughly and digest it so that I could make an effective program surrounding it.
